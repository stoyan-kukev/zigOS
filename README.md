# zigOS
A hobby operating system created with the Zig programming language.
From the start this OS is created and continues to be created with the help of the [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org).
Specifically the first commits of the OS are a complete port of the Bare Bones [tutorial](https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones) on the wiki from C to Zig.
I'm very much a hobbyist, and even more, a beginner to operating systems' development so there is probably a better way to do the things that I have done.
